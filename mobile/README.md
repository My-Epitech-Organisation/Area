## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Install Flutter
Follow the official guide: [Flutter Installation](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install)

flutter create .
```

### 2. Android Setup
Install Android Studio from [here](https://developer.android.com/studio)

Open Android Studio and install the required SDKs and emulators via the SDK Manager.

Ensure environment variables are set:
```bash
export ANDROID_HOME=$HOME/Android/Sdk
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/emulator:$ANDROID_HOME/tools:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools
```

### 3. iOS Setup (macOS only)
Install Xcode from the App Store or [here](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/).

Accept licenses and install command line tools:

```bash
sudo xcode-select --install
sudo xcodebuild -license accept
```

Install CocoaPods (if not already installed):
```bash
sudo gem install cocoapods
```

### 4. Run the Project

Clone the repository and navigate to the mobile directory:
```bash
git clone <repository_url>
cd AREA/mobile
```

Run on Android emulator
```bash
flutter emulators --launch <emulator_id>
```

Run on iOS simulator (if macOS available)
